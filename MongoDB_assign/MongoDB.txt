MongoDB
It is a non-relational database and the most popular NO sql database.
Unlike a relational database which involves tables, its rows and columns, and relationships between tables , mongoDB is designed related to a concept of documents.
In document oriented databases, the documents are encoded in some standard format or encoding.
mongoDB uses BSON style of encoding which is nothing but binary version of JSON.
BSON documents consist of an ordered list of elements. Each element consists of a field, type and its value.
<key,value> or <attribute,value> is the general way of representation of data in mongoDB.
A major advantage of using this type is that it will allow the database to be open-ended i.e., it can be extended without modifying existing code or data.
NoSQL databases lack ACID properties and are rather based on BASE properties.
mongoDB was built in C++.
