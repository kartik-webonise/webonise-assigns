The file 'language_parser.cpp' is the CPP program which for a user given file does following tasks :
- Identifies the language of the code (either PHP, RUBY or JAVA)
- Identifies the classes for the provided file
- Identifies the methods for the provided file
- Identifies the variables for the provided file

The file 'indentation.cpp' is the CPP program which for given RUBY file does the following tasks :
- Finds and displays number of tabs on each line
- Checks and reports the wrong indentation as 'Invalid'
Note : I have added some constraints to the program such as the a Ruby class or method should terminate by 'endc' keyword rather than 'end' keyword.
          The code runs as mentioned above for the attached file 'test.rb'
